    \begin{abstract}
        Maritime Search and Rescue operations rely on effective coordination and perfect readiness among several assets.
        This project proposes a modular Digital Twin framework to enable autonomous drone swarms to coordinate SAR missions in maritime environments.
        The framework seeks to integrate real-time sensor data, digital-physical system synchronization, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interactions to enhance situational awareness and decision-making.
        A simulation-based approach will be employed to validate that framework, focusing on swarm coordination, Human-Computer Interaction principles, and overall situational awareness.
        This work seeks to address the critical gap between centralized SAR systems and decentralized autonomous operations, with the aim of improving response times and increasing readiness by enabling the utilization of more economic assets.

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
        In 2024, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) reported over 278 Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations, a decrease of 16\% from 2023.
        Of which, ~56\% (158 of 278) were fishing vessels, which tend to be smaller, and thus more difficult to locate in high-stress environments.
        The same paper also states that, from 2015 to 2024, 78.8\% of investigated marine incidents and casualties involve a human element.
