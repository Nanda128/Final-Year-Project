    abstract = {Maritime Search and Rescue (MSAR) operations face significant challenges due to high uncertainty, dynamic conditions, and resource constraints. Additionally, rigid organizational structures and hierarchical human-centered communication frameworks, fail to adapt to the challenging conditions of maritime environments. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into MSAR operations, highlighting how AI can transform these systems through enhanced decision-making, real-time adaptability, decentralized autonomy, and resource optimization. Through analysis and synthesis, we identified and categorized key challenges in traditional SAR frameworks, such as inherent environmental and structural challenges. We discussed AI-driven solutions that offer efficient, autonomous, resilient, and decentralized coordination. Our thematic and statistical analysis of existing literature reveals significant research gaps, particularly regarding the holistic integration of AI across all SAR stages toward a decentralized fully autonomous paradigm shift. The paper also considers the technological challenges for the integration and adaptation of AI in SAR. By envisioning fully autonomous, AI-driven MSAR operations, this study sets the stage for future research and practical innovations, aiming to improve effectiveness and efficiency in maritime rescue efforts.},

    abstract = {This study proposes an enhanced multi-agent swarm control algorithm (EN-MASCA) to solve the problem of efficient patrolling of drone swarms in complex durian orchard environments. It introduces a virtual navigator model to dynamically adjust the patrol path of the drone swarm and perform obstacle avoidance and path optimization in real time according to environmental changes. Different from traditional algorithms that only rely on fixed path planning, the virtual navigator model significantly improves the flexibility and stability of the drone swarm in complex environments. It also applies deep reinforcement learning algorithms to path planning and obstacle avoidance of drone swarms for the first time, improving the algorithm’s adaptability and optimization capabilities by learning dynamic information in complex environments. This innovation significantly improves the applicability of existing methods in complex terrain and dynamic obstacle environments. Finally, it incorporates the simulation characteristics of biological swarm behavior, and on this basis, comprehensively optimizes the flight path, obstacle avoidance and swarm stability of the drone swarm. By improving control strategies and parameter design, it improves the trajectory consistency and mission completion efficiency of the UAV swarm during flight. In the experimental part, this study verified in detail the advantages of the EN-MASCA algorithm in terms of flight trajectory, flight stability, cluster consistency and task completion efficiency by constructing a six-degree-of-freedom UAV motion simulation model and real environment simulation. It provides an efficient and intelligent solution for collaborative patrol operations of drones in durian orchards, which has important practical application value and promotion prospects.},

    abstract = {The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

    abstract = {Summary Situation awareness (SA), a person's understanding of what is happening in the current situation, is critical for performance in a wide variety of domains, including aviation, air traffic control, driving, military operations, emergency management, health care, and power grid operations. This chapter discusses SA in teams, and the factors that underlie the development of team SA which significantly affects performance in many settings. Alternating between 'goal driven' and 'data driven' is characteristic of human information processing that underpins much of SA development in complex worlds. Interactive SA trainer attempts to bootstrap the natural process by exposing the trainee to many, many situations in a very short period of time using computer-based training tools. The chapter concludes with a discussion of validated techniques for measuring situation awareness in individuals and teams that can be used to evaluate new system designs and training programs, and to conduct further research on this important construct.}

    abstract = {The application of network centric operations to time-constrained command and control environments will mean that human operators will be increasingly responsible for multiple simultaneous supervisory control tasks. One such futuristic application will be the control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by a single operator. To achieve such performance in complex, time critical, and high risk settings, automated systems will be required both to guarantee rapid system response, as well as manageable workload for operators. Through the development of a simulation test bed for human supervisory control of multiple independent UAVs by a single operator, this paper presents recent efforts to investigate workload mitigation strategies as a function of increasing automation. A human-in-the-loop experiment revealed that under low workload conditions, operators' cognitive strategies were relatively robust across increasing levels of automated decision support. However, when provided with explicit automated recommendations and with the ability to negotiate with external agencies for delays in arrival times for targets, operators inappropriately fixated on the need to globally optimize their schedules. In addition, without explicit visual representation of uncertainty, operators tended to treated all probabilities uniformly. This study also revealed that operators who reached cognitive saturation adapted two very distinct management strategies, which led to varying degrees of success. Lastly, operators with management-by-exception decision support exhibited evidence of automation bias.}
